### Organizer (Owner of contract)
- Create and manage Store Contract & Ticket NFT Contract
- Set result for Lottery per times
- Mint Token for Players
- Receive 1% Ticket Price when a Player buy a ticket
### Players (Who buy Tickets)
- Buy ticket with pre-set Ticket price
- Receive prize equal to Total Prize devide Winner Count
- One player can only buy one Ticket per Ticket times
- Can manage all their Ticket NFT Token
